You wake up from a slumber so long, your brain is just now remembering how it functions, you start to understand you're a human and waking up, fantastic! Your house is old and got mold, dust and rust, smell that reeks making you breathe through your cheeks. Your body vaguely reminds you what comes next..

*choice

  #Oh yes... but of course, now I remmeber why sleep sounds so sweet! Lets' go back slumber.. 
    Gravity takes over *you tumble to your bed* 
    Your bed can't handle this any longer and runs outside
    *goto outside

  #*munch munch* you look down as your belly button wants to swallow like a black hole! You decide to make yourself a full course breakfast consisting of Toast, eggs, sausage, bacon, cereal... + more
    after eating you have the energy to run outa this hell hole and go as far as you can! *Run through wall*

  #GOOOooood ol' STREEEtch.... *CRACK* oof, how about a quick workout?

Now that you got your first wiff of fresh air in ages, you feel alive again! You embrace the adventure and run, while running you see somthing shiny on the floor, as you get close you realize its a coin on the floor... you forgot its value and are interrupted by a homeless person begging for it...

*choice

  #Give them the coin, it's theirs / they need it more..
    *set Good +1
    *goto HL

  #"I found it first! I'm hungry or will be hungry too and food is good." *keep coin & continue to run*

You run and run from all the madness you woke up to, you are pouring sweat, literally! you see a small plant in the distance and the peace and beauty of it resonates within you. As you run by it you notice it's dying from dehyrdation, how convenient since you're sweating!

*choice
  #You decide to sit down next to it so it can soak up all the dripping sweat!
    The plant restores a bit..
    *set Good +2
    *set Time -10

  #You run by it whipping your head at it sprinkling it with some of your sweat drops, "take that and goodluck!" you say...
    *set Energy -1

  #You run by the plant, making eye - to - leaf contact, "sruvial of the fittest" you say as you run psat it undeterred from your journey.

Sitting so peacfully... when suddenly you smell burning hair... you feel warmth on your behind and look back to notice a forest fire! You also feel hungry...

*choice
  #You're afraid the flower will die if you pluck it to take with you
    *choice
      #If the flower must die, it shall be with me and not with the fire!
        You pluck the flower with its roots and run!
        *set Good +1
        *goto runn
      #Fire is natural, the dried up flower will fuel it!
        You run away from the situation
        *set Good -1
        *goto runn
  #The fire won't get you, I will!
    You eat the plant and run off

You run like never before! Your feet move so fast it seems they're vibrating and multiplying, as you notice this phenomena you realize the floor is missing! When you look around you actually took off into the skies and your trajectory is for a MOUNTAIN! (3v3r3st)
